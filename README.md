## Android application that help's a gardener to manage his\hers clients:
client info: name, phone, method of payment, address (using google place picker), date of the job, notification for the job (can repeat once a week, twice a week, once a month), parts used for the job (grass,  plants and much more categories) , hourly rate , time estimate for the job , price (manually entered or calculated based on parts total price ,hourly rate and time estimation of course) , and there's a discount option too. 
The user can send the client the bill in a formatted way directly from the app to 
whatsapp\ sms\ mail to make life much easier. User can call, navigate to client directly from the app. There's a search function for the parts (divided by categories), search function for the customers the customers are ordered by closest job date first.
The user can add image for the parts that are uploaded to a firebase storage as a .webp format (goes through a compression) in order to save storage space (.webp are much smaller in size then .jpg and almost can't notice the difference) when the user wants to see the image full screen the image is downloaded from the storage and converted to .jpg. User can send the image\s to the client directly from the app (whatsapp\ mail).
There's also a tutorial that teaches the basics. The user must have or create a google account to use the app as an authentication and also the database is backed up on firebase storage can use multiple accounts each got its own database backup.
